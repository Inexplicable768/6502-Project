# 6502-Project
Software and firmware for my homebrew 6502 computer with vga graphics capabilities
I included a bios that is installed on 256k eeprom chip that handels graphics and basic capabilities
It may be upgraded to be an operating system stored in rom or BASIC

I also will add code for a few games which will be either 1. Booted from a floppy disk or 2. programmed directly into ROM

I based my motherboard off of Ben Eater's Design with some modifications and my VGA card using a Raspberi Pi Pico rather than a bulky era appropriate circuit
